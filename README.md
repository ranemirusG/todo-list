# todo-list
Select files with todo tasks

I have a directory (~/todo/) where I put the TODO's (one file per category).
Something like this:
~/todo/work
~/todo/home
~/todo/health
~/todo/... whatever

In each file I write down tasks, notes, links, whatever may be useful to tackle the tasks.
I use it for both short and long term tasks and goals...
Pretty personal, but useful.
